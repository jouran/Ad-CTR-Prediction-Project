# Ad-CTR-Prediction-Project


## Introduction
Given features of a new ad impression, output its click-through rate (CTR), i.e., the probability that it will be clicked. We explored several machine learning models and decided to go with Catboost for our final submission.


## DataSet
The file train.gz contains the training data. All features are categorical. The binary outcome variable is click. All data can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NYXsTO23Szv9PzHT4SXk_og8SGdEuUus?usp=sharing).


## Documentation
You can find a description of the data on the [**original Kaggle competition site**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data).

## Background
In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.
For this competition, we have provided 11 days worth of Avazu data to build and test prediction models. Can you find a strategy that beats standard classification algorithms?
